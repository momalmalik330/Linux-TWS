✅ 90 Days of DevOps Challenge - Week 2, Day 2 Completed!

Today’s mission: Mastering File & Directory Permissions in Linux 🚀

🔍 Task Summary:

📁 Create /devops_workspace directory📝 Inside it, create a file project_notes.txt🔐 Set permissions so that:

Owner can edit (read/write)

Group can only read

Others have no access

🏋️ Step-by-Step Implementation:

Created the workspace directory

sudo mkdir /devops_workspace

Moved inside the directory and created the file

cd /devops_workspace
sudo touch project_notes.txt

Changed the file owner to my current user

sudo chown empdmin:empdmin project_notes.txt

Set the correct permissions

sudo chmod 640 project_notes.txt

Verified permissions using ls -l

-rw-r----- 1 empdmin empdmin 0 Jun 26 18:24 project_notes.txt
