✅ 90 Days of DevOps Challenge - Week 2, Day 3 Completed!

Today’s task: Become a Log Analysis Ninja 🥷📜

🧠 Task Summary:

🔽 Download the log file from the repository🔍 Use grep to find all occurrences of the word "error"⏱ Use awk to extract timestamps and log levels🛡 Use sed to mask IP addresses with [REDACTED]🎯 Bonus: Find most frequent log entries!

⚙️ Commands I Used:

🔍 Step 1: Finding all errors

grep -i "error" Linux_2k.log

⏱ Step 2: Extracting timestamps & log levels

awk '{print $1, $2, $3}' Linux_2k.log

(Assuming first 3 fields are timestamp and level)

🛡 Step 3: Hiding IP addresses for security

sed -E 's/[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+/[REDACTED]/g' Linux_2k.log > safe_log.log

🎯 Bonus Step: Most frequent entries

sort Linux_2k.log | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

🧾 Why This Matters in DevOps?

Logs = Heartbeat of your infrastructure 💓

grep saves HOURS when hunting production bugs 🐞

awk formats logs like magic 📊

sed secures sensitive data like a firewall 🛡

Log analysis teaches you to read the mind of your servers. No tool is more powerful than the terminal in the hands of a DevOps engineer 💪💻
