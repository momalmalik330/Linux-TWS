# 💾 Day 6 - Automate Backups with Shell Scripting (90 Days of DevOps)

## ✅ Task Overview
Automate backup of the `/devops_workspace` directory using a shell script and schedule it via cron.

---

## 🛠️ What I Did

1. **Created a shell script** `/usr/local/bin/backup.sh`:
   - Compresses `/devops_workspace` into a `.tar.gz` file named with today’s date.
   - Saves the backup in `/backups`.
   - Displays a success message in green color.

2. **Made the script executable**:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
Scheduled the script using cron:

crontab -e
Then added:

0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
💡 What I Learned
Writing shell scripts using Bash.

Using tar for archiving.

Creating colored terminal output.

Automating tasks with cron.

📂 Sample Script

#!/bin/bash

SOURCE_DIR="/devops_workspace"
BACKUP_DIR="/backups"
DATE=$(date +%F)
FILENAME="backup_${DATE}.tar.gz"

mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/$FILENAME" "$SOURCE_DIR"

echo -e "\e[32m✅ Backup created successfully: $BACKUP_DIR/$FILENAME\e[0m"
